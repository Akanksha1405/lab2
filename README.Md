Docker: This is a container management. This is an open platform used to build, ship and distribute the running applications. It is used to manage the containers. Containers are nothing but the VMs. Docker is lightweight meaning it does not boots a separate OS per VM and therefore is faster. It maintains separation between the containers.
Vagrant: It is a tool which is used to provide a consistent development environment for multiple OS. It uses providers and provisioners to build and maintain the development environments.
